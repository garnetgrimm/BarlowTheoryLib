# Barlow & Sioros
This repository contains source code for many of the algorithms outlined by music theorist Clarence Barlow in his paper Two Essays on Theory. I can't seem to find a public link for the Barlow paper, as I was only able to access it using a college login. 

I also included some of the algorithms described Sioros & Guedes in their 2011 paper [A Formal Approach for High-Level Automatic Rhythm Generation](https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2011/bridges2011-233.pdf)

As of right now these algorithms are seperated into two distinct folders, mirroring the layout of barlows "Two Essays".
